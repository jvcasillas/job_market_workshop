# The interview

---

## The standard advice

- .large[Prepare for 15-20 questions (you'll probably get 5-10)]

--

- .large[Write 1-2 minute outlines of responses]--

- .large[Practice until they are second nature (this takes a lot of 
time, English and Spanish)]

--

- .large[Give the interviewers the opportunity to respond]

--

- .large[You don't have to show everything you know]

--

- .large[Show that you know what is needed]

--

- .large[Know your core theoretical stances (research, teaching)]

--

- .large[Know your audience (the campus, department, job)]

---

## How to prepare

### Make a departmental cheatsheet with:

.large[
- faculty names

- research interests

- recent publications

- recent history of department 

- areas dept. is known for

- new initiatives developing
]

---

### Practice question categories

.large[
1. *Dissertation*

2. *Short/long term publishing plans*

3. My place in the field

4. *Courses I can teach*

5. Teaching philosophy

6. Interest in program building

7. My understanding of the financial and organizational context of the department
]

.footnote[From *The professor is in* (blog), I think]

---

- Have you spoken w/ a publisher about your book? Where do you stand in negotiations?
- What is your research program for the next five years?
- What are your immediate and longer term publication plans?
- How would you teach a large intro class in ling/lit? How would you teach our intro course? Which text would you use? What kinds of assignments would you use?
- How would you teach our core theory seminar? Who would you have them read?
- How would you teach our methods course?
- Name two specialty courses you would teach, one undergraduate and one graduate?
- What inspires your teaching?
- How do you see your work fitting into our department?

---

### Example questions (cont.)

- We donâ€™t have a lot of funding for the kind of equipment/travel that you require for your research. How
would you work with this?
- Our campus is very student focused. You come from and R1. How do you see yourself fitting in?

## .right[play to your strengths...]

???

- ...have 3 or 4 "go to" areas, weave them in whenever you get a chance. Why?
- You can't trust them to bring up your best qualities, make a point to hit the topics you want to talk about
- Set up your narrative in a way that lets you drop little tangents about other research or work "That you can elaborate on if theres interest or time"

&gt; The modern scientist develops code in the 
&gt; open, publishes data and code open source, 
&gt; posts preprints, subits to and reviews for 
&gt; traditional journals, but may also write 
&gt; blog posts and use social media... These 
&gt; activities can dramatically increase the 
&gt; profile of scientists, particularly junior 
&gt; scientists, if done well.
